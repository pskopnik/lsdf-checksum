# Illustrations

The illustrations (`.drawio`) were created with [diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/).

The XML files are the native representation created through "File" → "Save as..." and can be imported through "File" → "Open from" → "Device...".

Other formats may be derived from each diagram.
For example, SVGs of individual pages can be created through "File" → "Export as" → "SVG...".
